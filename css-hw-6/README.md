You've gotten some practice with what I would consider a standard webpage layout. And you're getting good at it too. Now, it's time to let you loose! :D

1. Form an idea in your head about how you want your page to look.
2. Draw the final form of that page on paper.
3. Decompose that final product into the steps required to build it, very roughly drawing out each step.
4. Bring your idea to life!
