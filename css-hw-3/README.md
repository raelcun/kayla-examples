This exercise has a tiny piece of a bunch of things that are required of a good web developer.

1. You have to be able to think about a problem without a computer
2. You have to be able to mock up an idea
3. You have to be able to explain an idea to someone else
4. You have to be able to implement your idea

I want you to do the following:

1. Get an idea in your head of a css layout that you'd like to create
2. Mock up your idea by drawing it out on paper
3. Come to me and explain to me what your idea is
4. Write the html and css to make your idea come alive
